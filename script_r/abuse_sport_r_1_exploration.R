# 1. Objective ---------------------------------------------------------------------


# Objective: Data Preparation and Validation for Initial Phase of Data Analysis

# Description: This objective entails the verification of data integrity, identification and amendment of discrepancies, and the restructuring of data into a format that is conducive for ensuing analytical tasks, ensuring the data is tidy, consistent, and adequately prepared for rigorous analysis.


# 2. Packages ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here are some widely-used packages from the `tidyverse` ecosystem I will use for data management and visualization:

### dplyr (1.1.3): Provides functions for data manipulation and transformation, such as filtering, summarizing, and joining tables.
### readr (2.1.4): Facilitates importing and exporting data, offering fast and friendly ways to read tabular data into R.
### forcats (1.0.0): Tools for working with categorical data (factors) in R, including changing factor levels or reordering them.
### stringr (1.5.0): Simplifies working with strings by providing functions for common string manipulation tasks.
### ggplot2 (3.4.4): A system for declaratively creating graphics, providing high-level functions for creating visually appealing and informative data visualizations.
### tibble (3.2.1): Extends R's data frames with better formatting and subsetting functionalities.
### lubridate (1.9.3): Simplifies working with dates and times by providing functions to parse, manipulate, and do arithmetic with date-times.
### tidyr (1.3.0): Offers functions to tidy data, reshaping it into a standardized format that's easy to work with.
### purrr (1.0.2): Provides tools for functional programming and vectorized operations, enabling cleaner and more modular code.
